# [Power BI] Custom Timeline Visual
One of the things that I find myself doing repeatedly is coming up with powerpoint slides to show a timeline of events. This gets rather annoying as the boilerplate activity to make everything scale correctly is quite tedious.

I have created this visual to help others visualise this data easily. Currently though, the labels are automatically coloured using the colour palette that had been chosen. Custom colours seems to be difficult as I'm probably doing something wrong with the *enumerateObjectInstances* function when the format objects are enumerated. I think I'm not binding it correctly.

Anyhow, the visual works and is a good first cut.

### TODO:
- Custom colours for different labels
